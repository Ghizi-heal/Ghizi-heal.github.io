# Hi There!

My name is Ghizi. I'm an EFL teacher in a hoodie. I'm passionate about teaching. I'm an aspiring writer and I write about all things related to teaching English, and  teaching and learning in general. I'm also looking forward to bring my classroom experience to you O' my dear readers!

I believe teachers are leaders. Leardeship is all about showing the way and letting students find their path.
